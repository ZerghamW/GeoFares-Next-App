# GeoFares-Next-App

## Introducing GeoFares, a ReactJS-based web app that calculates fares spatially!
In this digital age, we need more software that is user-friendly and addresses our everyday needs. Apps such as Google Maps, Uber, and Ola are great examples of how software can simplify our lives. Commuting by cab can be quite challenging in India, especially in the smaller cities and towns. This is because finding reliable cabs can be expensive and time-consuming. With the growing number of smartphone users across the globe, there has been an increase in demand for apps that cater to the mind. ReactJS developers have come up with a new geographical app with exact fares based on your location called GeoFares: A Web App Made With ReactJS That Can Calculate Fares Spatially!

## What is GeoFares?

GeoFares is a web app that calculates the fare for any cab, rickshaw, or any other mode of transportation that has a fixed fare based on your current location. The app has been built with React JS and PostgreSQL. It is a full-client application that can run on any device with a browser, independent of the operating system and internet connectivity. To book a cab, you enter the start and end points of the journey along with the number of passengers, and the app finds you the best options near you.

## Why use React JS for geo-based apps?

React JS is a front-end JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. It is a popular choice amongst web and software developers because of its scalability and ease of use. It is considered a great tool for building apps that need to be responsive and run smoothly on different devices and browsers. The features that make React a great choice for developing a GeoFares-like app are as follows. - -Large and Growing Community: React is maintained by a large and active community of developers. There are lots of tools, resources, and open-source projects available for learning, mentorship, and integration. -Separation of Concerns: React has a unique way of separating concerns. It does not rely on any template engine or other dependencies and can be used with any backend technology. This way, the creation becomes more modular and reusable. -Isomorphic JavaScript: React has an isomorphic JavaScript code, which means that it can be used to build a web app as well as a desktop app. This makes it a great choice for geo-based apps, as they can run on any device with a browser and don't require any native code. -Declarative Rendering: React makes a web app declarative, i.e., the app controls the structure of the page by specifying how the page should look at any given time rather than specifying the actual content to be displayed.

## What does the app actually do?

The app does a lot of things, actually. When a user enters their location, the app finds the cabs nearby. -When a user enters the start and end points of the journey, the app finds the best options near the user. When a user selects the preferred option, the app finds the fare for that particular journey. -When a user confirms an order, the app updates the journey details such as the start time, driver, and end time and also sends these details to the user. -When a driver confirms a journey, the app sends details to the user and prompts them to start the journey. -When a journey is completed, the app notifies the user and the driver.

## Conclusion

GeoFares is a good example of how React JS can be used to create a sleek, intuitive, and user-friendly app. React is a front-end framework created by Facebook. It is a popular choice amongst web and software developers because of its scalability and ease of use. This app has proven to be useful for commuters and cab drivers alike. It is estimated that the number of users has increased by 100% since the launch of the app. With such an impressive track record, it is safe to say that React JS is definitely worth a try.
